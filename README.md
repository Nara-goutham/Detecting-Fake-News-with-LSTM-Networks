# Detecting-Fake-News-with-LSTM-Networks
This project is an AI-based Fake News Detection System that uses deep learning  to classify news articles as real or fake based on their content. It employs NLP and an LSTM-based neural network to analyze textual data and make predictions. download it from drive link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g00rRXnw_IrPYv-lEloNiyedKM1E5R2U/view?usp=sharing
